#Notes
##Angular Intro
1. AngularJS Extends HTML
>AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.
>The `ng-app` directive defines an AngularJS application. It tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.
>The `ng-model` directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data. It binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.
>The `ng-bind` directive binds application data to the HTML view. It binds the innerHTML of the <p> element to the application variable name.

2. AngularJS Expressions
>AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: `{{ expression }}`.
>AngularJS will "output" data exactly where the expression is written.

3. AngularJS Applications
>AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.
>AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.
>The `ng-app` directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.
